# Create Your First Command ⌨️

Save frequently used commands for quick access. No more looking up complex syntax!

## Two Ways to Create Commands

### 1. AI Generation (Recommended)
Describe what you want in plain English:
- "Kill process on port 3000"
- "Create a new React component"
- "Compress all images in current folder"

### 2. Manual Entry
Save any command you use often:
- `docker-compose up -d`
- `git checkout -b feature/{{branch}}`
- `npm run test -- --watch`

## Using Variables

Make your commands flexible with placeholders:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/{{branch}}
```

Cmdify will prompt you to fill in `{{branch}}` when running the command.

## Organization

- **Tags:** Group related commands (e.g., `git`, `docker`, `npm`)
- **Favorites:** Star your most-used commands for quick access
- **Search:** Find commands instantly with fuzzy search

## Keyboard Shortcut

Press `Cmd+Shift+C` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+C` (Windows/Linux) to quickly create or run commands!
